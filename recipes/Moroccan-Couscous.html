    <p>A flavorful Moroccan chicken stew that features aromatic spices and nice vegetables served over whole-grain couscous. <br/>
        This recipe was actually a real chicken contest winner! Vegetables and even meat can vary according to taste, but I <br/>
        find squash, carrots, bell peppers, and lamb work well in this recipe. Even though the spices seem strange, the flavors <br/>
        are subtle but fragrant. A real favorite at home.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat couscous</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>5 whole cloves, crushed</li>
